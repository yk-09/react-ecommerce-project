# 🌿 Kaamna — Where Money Ends, Desire Begins

A modern eCommerce application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Axios**, and **MockAPI**.

Kaamna is a complete frontend eCommerce experience featuring product browsing, search, cart management, delivery selection, checkout flow, order placement, order history, and package tracking.

This project was originally built using **Vanilla JavaScript** and later fully migrated to **React + TypeScript** to improve scalability, maintainability, and developer experience.

## 🧠 Technical Concepts Used

### React

- Functional Components
- Props
- Component Composition
- Conditional Rendering
- Lists & Keys
- Controlled Inputs
- State Lifting

### Hooks

- useState
- useEffect
- useRef

### TypeScript

- Interfaces
- Type-safe API calls
- Typed React Props
- Generics
- Utility Types

### API Integration

- Axios
- Async / Await
- Promise.all
- REST APIs

### Routing

- React Router
- Route Parameters
- Query Parameters
- Navigation

### State Management

Shared state architecture:

```txt
App
│
├── HomePage
│   └── Product Cards
│
├── CheckoutPage
│   ├── Cart Summary
│   └── Payment Summary
│
├── OrderPage
│
└── TrackingPage
```

State is lifted to the App component and shared across pages through props.

## 🌐 Backend

The application uses MockAPI for backend services.

### Products

```txt
GET /products
```

### Cart

```txt
GET    /cart
POST   /cart
PUT    /cart/:id
DELETE /cart/:id
```

### Orders

```txt
GET  /orders
POST /orders
```

### Delivery Options

```txt
GET /delivery-options
```

---

## 🔄 Data Flow Example

### Add To Cart

```txt
User Clicks Add To Cart
            ↓
handleAddToCart()
            ↓
Check Existing Item
       ↓           ↓
     Yes           No
       ↓           ↓
Update Qty      Create Item
       ↓           ↓
Update State Locally
       ↓
UI Re-renders
```

---

### Place Order

```txt
User Clicks
"Fulfill Your Desire"
          ↓
Create Order
          ↓
Store In Orders API
          ↓
Delete Cart Items
          ↓
Clear Cart State
          ↓
Navigate To Orders Page
```

## 🎯 Challenges Solved

### React Migration

One of the biggest goals of this project was migrating a complete eCommerce application from:

```txt
Vanilla JavaScript
        ↓
React + TypeScript
```

This migration required:

- Component architecture design
- State management redesign
- Event handling refactor
- API integration refactor
- TypeScript adoption

---

### Avoiding Unnecessary API Requests

Instead of refetching the cart after every update:

```txt
POST
↓
GET Cart Again ❌
```

The application updates local state directly:

```txt
POST
↓
Update State Locally ✅
```

This reduces network requests and improves responsiveness.
